If you've been dreaming of learning to play the guitar for a while now, or if you've already got some basics down and want to take your skills to the next level, then you've come to the right place!

I offer guitar lessons for beginners through to advanced players, and my teaching style is tailored to your individual needs and abilities. Not only will I help you master techniques and exercises, but I'll also give you a wide range of songs to add to your repertoire, and teach you valuable habits and routines to help you progress even further.

One of my top priorities is creating a comfortable learning environment, which is why I've designed my teaching space to help you focus solely on your guitar playing. The excellent acoustics and recording options also allow you to document and reflect on your progress.
