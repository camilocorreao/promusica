I am a graduate of the concert guitar from the MDW, the former University of Music and Performing Arts in Vienna, under the direction of Professor Walter Würdinger. After a long break, I decided to resiled my passion for the guitar and planed and developed the proMúsica Studio. I applied the knowledge I've gained over the past few years about Linux and the open source movement to install and configure hardware and software, as well as adjust the acoustics in the room.

I'm proud to have a studio built on open source technologies, which allows me to provide my music, my students, and my clients with expanded capabilities.
